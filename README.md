# can-ai-park
The goal of this hack is to use ML to identify if parking spots are free on the Daresay parking by analysing photos taken down on the parking from Daresay HQ in Victoria Tower.

What we need is:
- Sample data of parking lots from above.
- Train a model that can answer if a lot is free or not.
- A camera capturing Daresay HQ parking lot to get it's current state.
- Run the model in client(s), web, mobile etc.

Can we make it together during the summer of 2019?
